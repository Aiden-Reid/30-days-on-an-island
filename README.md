This project is a decision-based game. Your plane has crash-landed near a tropical island and you must survive until you are rescued. On this island, you'll have many difficult choices you'll need to make to survive. This game was coded in C++ and can be played by pasting the source code into any compiler and playing in the terminal. The code was written in Notepad++ by Aiden Reid.
