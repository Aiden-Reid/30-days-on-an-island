project idea: survive 30 days on an island after a plane crash

plane crashed in water and you have to swim to shore with only certain amount of supplies

survive with supplies on island and from plane crash (6 slots)
	random items from plane crash
		water bottles (1 slot size each)
		first aid (2 slot size)
		food (1 slot size each)
		blankets (2 slot size)
		radio (3 slot size)
		lighter (1 slot size)
		gun w/ 6 shots (2 slot size)
		rope (1 slot size)
		
items on island
	animals
		boars
		birds
		spiders
		monkeys
		fish
		ants
		chickens
		scorpions
	food
		coconuts
		berries
			some could be poisonous
		pears
	environment
		palm trees
		rocks

scenarios (2-4 a day)
	go out to get food (asked every day)
		either fishing, hunting, or gathering fruit (takes different energy for each decision)
		possibility of food poisoning
			have to cook certain foods
			some fruits could poison you
		possibility of shark attack while fishing
		some food gives more energy than others
	weather (rain, wind, flood, heat)
		if no shelter, lose a lot of energy
		if shelter, lose less energy
	animal attacks/eats food
		possibly lose energy
	spoiling food
		uneaten food will spoil after a certain amount of days
	food rationing
		asks if player wants to eat or ration food till next days
		gain/lose hunger accordingly
	random item washes up to shore (only happens after day 10)
		could range from good or useless items
	rescued early (only happens after day 10)
		higher chance if bring radio
			radio has certain amount of uses
		ships/planes could pass by and you have to use flare
			ships/planes could not see flare (50/50?)
	chance of randomly dying
		very low chance
		animal attack/disease/infection/spider bite
	making a fire
		materials: leaves, bark, rocks
		if have lighter takes less energy
		else takes a lot of energy
	
stats (starting 75-100 for each)
	if any stat goes to 0, game immediately ends
	
	hunger
		goes down random amount if not eating (~-10)
	thirst
		goes down random amount if not drinking (~-20)
	energy
		getting food requires energy, but eating gives more energy
		making shelter takes energy
		getting attacked at night
		gain energy from sleeping
			gain more if you have shelter
	karma
		not visible to player
		if a lot of bad things happen to the player, a good thing could happen to balance it out and vice versa
